        Porterhouse takes security very seriously. So seriously that ALMOST nothing is saved in the cloud. So what data do we save?
      </p>
      <p>
        <h5>Data we save</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>We save the email address you use to login (obviously).</li>
          <li>We save the your ENCRYPTED password.</li>
          <li>The message text that you create.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h5>Data we DO NOT save</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>No contacts, none, zero, not a shread.</li>
          <li>No phone numbers.</li>
          <li>No personally identifying information of you or your contacts.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Some details</h4>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Porterhouse takes note of your contacts GUID. This is an ID that Apple generates that contains NO personally identifying information about that contact.
        This ID allows us to know which contact is connected to which message.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of this, if an account were to be compromised, the only thing they could read would be the message's content. That is it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>
        How do I know you're telling the truth? Test it!
      </h4>
      <hr />
      <p>
        If you want to test this yourself, create another user on your Mac, download Porterhouse, and login. When you go to see your message recipients, nothing will be listed.
        You'll see a message stating "COULD NOT FIND RECIPIENT, CONTACT MAY HAVE BEEN DELETED.".
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, this is because we save no information, if we can't find a matching ID or (GUID) in your Contacts then, as far as, Porterhouse is concerned, it doesn't exist.
      </p>
