            Johnathan, a trainer, wakes up at <strong>5AM every day to send out a daily</strong>, personalized workout routine
            to his <strong>50 customers</strong>. Customers fit into different buckets depending on their fitness goals,
            Core, Strength, Flexibility, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            After creating the routines he gets on his Mac, opens the
            Messages app and <strong>starts copying and pasting the routine to every customer</strong> in each bucket.
            By the end of the process he has <strong>spent over an hour</strong>, replacing the first name, attaching a
            PDF or video.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Porterhouse has cut that time down by 80%</strong>, leaving him with time in his morning
            to hangout with his family and enjoy his new daughter.

        <p>
            Local businesses are vital to our economy and business is hard.
        </p>
        <p>
            Porterhouse could provide a way for <strong>local business owners to reach out to their client base</strong> to let
            them know of new
            shipments, a rare product that has just come in, or an event their hosting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Porterhouse would <strong>give customers the local attention they enjoy</strong> from their local businesses and <strong>allow
            customers and owners to
            communicate direct together</strong> and help <strong>drive sales</strong> in an environment that is ever more difficult
            for local retail.
