        Johnathan, a trainer, wakes up at <b>5AM every day to send out a daily</b>, personalized workout routine
        to his <b>50 customers</b>. Customers fit into different buckets depending on their fitness goals,
        Core, Strength, Flexibility, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        After creating the routines he gets on his Mac, opens the
        Messages app and <b>starts copying and pasting the routine to every customer</b> in each bucket.
        By the end of the process he has <b>spent over an hour</b>, replacing the first name, attaching a
        PDF or video.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Porterhouse has cut that time down by 80%</b>, leaving him with time in his morning
        to hangout with his family and enjoy his new daughter.

      <p>
        Campaigning is notoriously an <b>impersonal activity</b> in democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Porterhouse could provide a way for someone running for political office to <b>connect directly with their large 
        donors by mass messaging</b> to them updates through their personal phone number. Communicating with them through
        a medium (iMessage/SMS) that is <b>personal, direct</b>, and warrents a response, <b>encouraging conversation and developing
        a deeper rapport</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, when <b>sending attachments through our attachment and analytics feature</b>, canidates to track WHO opens them and interacts with
        the content sent out allowing them to see who needs more attention.

        Small Local Businesses

    <div style="line-height: 2em; font-size: large;">
      <p>
        Local businesses are vital to our economy and business is hard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Porterhouse could provide a way for <b>local business owners to reach out to their client base</b> to let them know of new
        shipments, a rare product that has just come in, or an event their hosting. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Porterhouse would <b>give customers the local attention they enjoy</b> from their local businesses and <b>allow customers and owners to 
        communicate direct together</b> and help <b>drive sales</b> in an environment that is ever more difficult for local retail.
